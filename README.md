# Collaborative Multi-agent Reinforcement Dialog Model
This is the Collaborative multi-agent dialogue model I am building for my minor project using reinforcement learning.

# Goal
Make 2 Reinforcement learning trained python chatbots to interact in an environment like social media sites: facebook, instagram and observe and analyse their behaviour and accuracy.
We intend to apply Wolf-PHC to transform learning into a stochastic game so the model learns slowly when its correct and fast when its wrong

# Installations uptill now
Python == 3.6 <br />
tensorflow == 1.4 <br />
nltk <br />
tflearn <br />
numpy

# Implementation
After installing all dependencies stated above you can run the project using <br />
`python bot.py` and `python userbot.py` for your pre-trained agents if there is on dialog flow <br/>
Enter your client access token, email-id and password for facebook to run the bots on facebook<br />
or <br/>
`python main.py` for your python chatbot
